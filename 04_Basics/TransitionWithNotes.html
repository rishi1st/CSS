                    /* Transitions :- enable you to define the transition between two state of an element. or,
                    In CSS,a transition is a way to change property values smoothly over a specified duration. Here are the key properties of CSS transitions: 

                    1. transition-property: Specifies the name of the CSS property the transition effect is for. You can specify multiple properties by separating them with commas1. 
                    2. transition-duration: Defines the duration over which transitions should occur. You can specify the time in seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms)
                    3. transition-timing-function: Describes how the intermediate values of the CSS properties being affected by a transition effect are calculated. This lets you establish an acceleration curve,
                    so the speed of the transition can vary over its duration. 
                    4. transition-delay: Allows you to define a delay before the transition starts. You can also specify this in seconds or milliseconds2. */

          1. ease: This is the default value. It starts off fast, then slows down, and speeds up again before coming to a stop. Itâ€™s like easing into and out of the transition1.
          2. linear: The transition happens at a constant speed from start to end1.
          3. ease-in: The transition starts slowly and then speeds up until it stops1.
          4. ease-out: The transition starts quickly and then slows down as it comes to an end1.
          5. ease-in-out: The transition starts and ends slowly, but is quicker in the middle
