1. Opacity:
🟡  The opacity property specifies the transparency of an element.
🟡  It takes a value from 0.0 (completely transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque).
🟡  When you set opacity for an element, it affects the entire element and all its children.
for example : 
/* Makes the element and its content 50% transparent */
element {
  opacity: 0.5;
}
The opacity level describes the transparency level, where 1.0 is not transparent at all, 0.5 is 50% see-through, and 0.0 is completely transparent.

2. Alpha Channel (RGBA):
🟡 RGBA color values are an extension of RGB color values with an alpha channel.
🟡 The alpha channel specifies the opacity of the object.
🟡 An RGBA color value is specified with : rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)


🟡 The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque).
🟡 When you set rgba for an element, it only makes the element’s background transparent, leaving its content unaffected.

for example :- 
/* Green background with 30% opacity */
element {
  background: rgba(76, 175, 80, 0.3);
}
🟡 RGBA color values are supported in modern browsers like IE9+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera.


In summary, opacity affects the entire element and its content, while RGBA allows you to control the background’s transparency separately from the content. Choose the one that best suits your design needs! 🎨👍
